You\n can then customize the site visitors' experience before they actually pay for the plan.\n\n The following outlines the steps for customizing the paid plan purchase:\n\n 1. Get a list of membership plans from one of:\n    * A dataset connected to the Plans collection.\n    * A query on the Plans collection.\n 1. A *logged-in* site visitor selects a membership plan by clicking the plan or a button.\n 1. The corresponding event handler calls the [`orderPlan()`](wix-paid-plans.html#orderPlan) function to handle the initial order of a plan.\n 1. You create and customize a series of elements for continuing the purchase, such as lightboxes,\n    forms, and so on. The site visitor enters payment information using these elements.\n 1. Implement a payment method, such as the Wix Pay API, to accept payments and purchase the plan.\n\n\n\n To use the Paid Plans API, import `wixPaidPlans` from the `wix-paid-plans` module:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import wixPaidPlans from 'wix-paid-plans';\n   ```",
          "To work with the Paid Plans API, you need to publish your site." ] } }
