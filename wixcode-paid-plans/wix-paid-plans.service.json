You can add elements, such as confirmation lightboxes and forms, to customize the visitor experience. You can\n implement any payment method.\n\n To let the visitor request a plan, call the [`orderPlan()`](wix-paid-plans.html#orderPlan) function.\n\n\n The following outlines the steps for customizing the paid plan purchase:\n\n 1. Get a list of membership plans from one of:\n    * A dataset connected to the Plans collection.\n    * A query on the Plans collection.\n 1. A *logged-in* site visitor selects a membership plan by clicking the plan or a button.\n 1. The corresponding event handler calls the [`orderPlan()`](wix-paid-plans.html#orderPlan) function to handle the initial order of the plan.\n 1. The site visitor uses a series of customized elements, such as lightboxes,\n    forms, and payment methods, to complete the purchase.\n\n\n To use the Paid Plans API, import `wixPaidPlans` from the `wix-paid-plans` module:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import wixPaidPlans from 'wix-paid-plans';\n   ```",
