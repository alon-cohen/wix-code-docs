# What's New

We're always adding and updating the Corvid APIs, and we want you to have one place to find all of our latest changes and cool additions.

We also keep a list of **doc bugs** that are in our backlog, with information that can be helpful to our users even before they are fixed. You can see them [here](https://view.monday.com/97005963-d254f39325f60e6d86ffb64c39192f84).

## üóìÔ∏è December 7, 2020
### New API: VideoBox

`Wix Editor Elements ($w)`

Corvid APIs are now available to control how videos play in [`VideoBox`](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/$w/videobox) elements on your site. Video boxes allow you to showcase your videos in beautifully-designed video containers. Unlike VideoPlayer elements, VideoBox elements do not have controls, text descriptions, titles and cannot be displayed in full screen mode. This gives video boxes a clean look.
You can use the APIs to manage video boxes for: 
* Videos uploaded to your site
* Transparent videos uploaded to your site
* Videos/Transparent videos from the  Wix Media library

### Updated:textInput.maxLength remove max length

`Wix Editor Elements ($w)`

The instructions to remove the [`maximum length`](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/$w/textinput/maxlength) restriction incorrectly stated to set maxLength to 0. We clarified that you can format the text using the html property.

### Updated:text styles

We listed the supported styles and formats for [`text type elements`](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/$w/text/introduction) but did not explain how to use them. We clarified that you can format the text using the html property.

### Updated:uploadButton.reset 

`Wix Editor Elements ($w)`

We clarified that the [`reset()`](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/$w/uploadbutton/reset) function clears the files in the value property.

### Updated:radioButtonGroup options 

`Wix Editor Elements ($w)`

The description incorrectly stated that [`options`](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/$w/radiobuttongroup/options) is an object. We clarified that options is an array of option objects.

### Updated: getCheckoutOptions slotID

`wix-bookings`

In the [`getCheckoutOptions`](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/wix-bookings/getcheckoutoptions) parameter table, slot_ID was formatted incorrectly. The correct format is slotID.

### Updated: wixWindow.scrollTo coordinates

`wix-window`

In the [`scrollTo`](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/wix-window/scrollto) function we didn‚Äôt mention how to get the coordinates of a given location. We added how to get the coordinates of a location on the page using the Editor toolbar.

### Updated: wixLocation URL structure

`wix-location`

The layout for describing the different parts of the [`URL`](https://www.wix.com/corvid/reference/wix-location/introduction) was a bit confusing. We changed the URL breakdown to match the same layout as the wixHttpFunctionRequest object in the wix-http-functions API for consistency.
